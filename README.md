Unauthorized scanning can be intrusive, as it probes devices, gathers information, and potentially exploits vulnerabilities. Even if performed with good intentions, scanning without permission can erode trust and violate ethical norms.
Unauthorized scanning can be considered hacking or cyber trespassing, even if it is conducted with good intentions. Always ensure that proper authorization is obtained before scanning any network.
ISPs have policies in place that dictate what can and cannot be performed over their networks. While these policies differ from one provider to another, most prohibit activities that could:
 * Damage the network
 * Interfere with other usersâ€™ access
 * Facilitate malicious actions
Scanning other networks through your ISP without explicit consent usually falls under this umbrella of prohibited actions and can lead to account suspension or termination.
Unauthorized port scanning can lead to legal issues, as it may violate laws regarding access to computer systems in many jurisdictions.
