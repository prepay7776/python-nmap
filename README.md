Unauthorized scanning can be intrusive, as it probes devices, gathers information, and potentially exploits vulnerabilities.<br>
Even if performed with good intentions, scanning without permission can erode trust and violate ethical norms.<br>
Unauthorized scanning can be considered hacking or cyber trespassing, even if it is conducted with good intentions.<br> 
Always ensure that proper authorization is obtained before scanning any network.<br>
ISPs have policies in place that dictate what can and cannot be performed over their networks. While these policies differ from one provider to another, most prohibit activities that could:
 * Damage the network
 * Interfere with other usersâ€™ access
 * Facilitate malicious actions

Scanning other networks through your ISP without explicit consent usually falls under this umbrella of prohibited actions and can lead to account suspension or termination.<br>
Unauthorized port scanning can lead to legal issues, as it may violate laws regarding access to computer systems in many jurisdictions.<br>
